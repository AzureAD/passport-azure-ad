# Microsoft Azure Active Directory Passport.js Plug-In
=============

_passport-azure-ad_ is a collection of [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) Strategies 
to help you integrate with Azure Active Directory. It includes OpenID Connect, 
WS-Federation, and SAML-P authentication and authorization. These providers let you 
integrate your Node app with Microsoft Azure AD so you can use its many features, 
including web single sign-on (WebSSO), Endpoint Protection with OAuth, and JWT token 
issuance and validation.

_passport-azure-ad_ has been tested to work with both [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) 
and with [Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services).

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-azure-ad

## Usage

### Configure strategy

This sample uses the OAuth2Bearer Strategy:

```javascript

// We pass these options in to the ODICBearerStrategy.

var options = {
    // The URL of the metadata document for your app. We will put the keys for token validation from the URL found in the jwks_uri tag of the in the metadata.
    identityMetadata: config.creds.identityMetadata,
    issuer: config.creds.issuer,
    audience: config.creds.audience

};

var bearerStrategy = new BearerStrategy(options,
    function(token, done) {
        log.info('verifying the user');
        log.info(token, 'was the token retreived');
        findById(token.sub, function(err, user) {
            if (err) {
                return done(err);
            }
            if (!user) {
                // "Auto-registration"
                log.info('User was added automatically as they were new. Their sub is: ', token.sub);
                users.push(token);
                owner = token.sub;
                return done(null, token);
            }
            owner = token.sub;
            return done(null, user, token);
        });
    }
);
```
This sample uses the OIDCStrategy:

```javascript
passport.use(new OIDCStrategy({
    callbackURL: config.creds.returnURL,
    realm: config.creds.realm,
    clientID: config.creds.clientID,
    clientSecret: config.creds.clientSecret,
    oidcIssuer: config.creds.issuer,
    identityMetadata: config.creds.identityMetadata,
    skipUserProfile: config.creds.skipUserProfile,
    responseType: config.creds.responseType,
    responseMode: config.creds.responseMode
  },
  function(iss, sub, profile, accessToken, refreshToken, done) {
    if (!profile.email) {
      return done(new Error("No email found"), null);
    }
    // asynchronous verification, for effect...
    process.nextTick(function () {
      findByEmail(profile.email, function(err, user) {
        if (err) {
          return done(err);
        }
        if (!user) {
          // "Auto-registration"
          users.push(profile);
          return done(null, profile);
        }
        return done(null, user);
      });
    });
  }
));
```

### Provide the authentication callback for OIDCStrategy

To complete the sample, provide a route that corresponds to the path 
configuration parameter that is sent to the strategy:

```javascript

app.get('/login', 
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {
    log.info('Login was called in the Sample');
    res.redirect('/');
});

// POST /auth/openid/return
//   Use passport.authenticate() as route middleware to authenticate the
//   request.  If authentication fails, the user will be redirected back to the
//   login page.  Otherwise, the primary route function function will be called,
//   which, in this example, will redirect the user to the home page.
app.post('/auth/openid/return',
  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {
    
    res.redirect('/');
  });

  app.get('/logout', function(req, res){
  req.logout();
  res.redirect('/');
});

```

## Samples and Documentation

[We provide a full suite of sample applications and documentation on GitHub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/samples/?service=active-directory) 
to help you get started with learning the Azure Identity system. This includes 
tutorials for native clients such as Windows, Windows Phone, iOS, OSX, Android, 
and Linux. We also provide full walkthroughs for authentication flows such as 
OAuth2, OpenID Connect, Graph API, and other awesome features. 

Azure Identity samples for this plug-in is here: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-node-webapp-openidconnect](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-node-webapp-openidconnect)


## Community Help and Support

We leverage [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) to work with the community on supporting Azure Active Directory and its SDKs, including this one. We highly recommend you ask your questions on Stack Overflow (we're all on there!) Also browser existing issues to see if someone has had your question before. 

We recommend you use the "adal" tag so we can see it! Here is the latest Q&A on Stack Overflow for ADAL: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/adal](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/adal)
